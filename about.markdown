I am a security researcher interested in low-level software engineering, reverse engineering, all things information security and photography!

I found vulnerabilities in Apple's App Sandbox on macOS [[1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208849), [2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210919)], hacked fitness trackers and tracked down and fixed kernel bugs in wireless routers you might have at home. Head on over to my [Github](https://github.com/0xbf00) and get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xdead10cc).
