I am a security researcher interested in low-level software engineering, reverse engineering, all things information security and photography!

I found vulnerabilities in Apple's App Sandbox on macOS, hacked fitness trackers and tracked down and fixed kernel bugs in wireless routers you might have at home. Head on over to my [Github](https://github.com/0xbf00) and get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xdead10cc).
