This is my personal site, where I mostly write about
fun little projects related to information security.

Content sprinkled in between could also be related
to Haskell, C, or the myriad of tools useful for
reverse engineering.

The design of this site is pretty much stolen from
[Raymond Sohn](http://raysohn.com). Once upon a
time, his site featured more content than the
three dots you find there now. Ray, I don't know
what happened to you, but I hope you are OK!
Thank you for lending me your design. I am sure it would have taken at least another year before 
something appeared on here otherwise.
