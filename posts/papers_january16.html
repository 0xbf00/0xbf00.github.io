        Papers - January 2016
        <span class="date">January 11, 2016</span>
    </h2>
    <p>Second installment of the <em>Papers</em> series. Be sure to read <a href="../posts/papers_september.html">the first one</a> from a couple of months ago!</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07528v1.pdf">&gt; <strong>The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial Settings</strong> (2015)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Adversarial samples</em> are samples produced in such way that they differ minimally from beneign samples. Even though humans still correctly classify them, a DNN fails and produces class labels controlled by the adversary. Well written, <em>understandable</em> paper. Impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2014/papers/5103a140.PDF">&gt; <strong>Mind your language(s): A discussion about languages and security</strong> (2014)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LangSec is a hugely important part of InfoSec that does not currently receive the attention it deserves. Absence of type-checking, (implicit) casts and overloading all constitute possible security problems that need to be carefully addressed. The paper is full of interesting tidbits, quotes and rather amusing vulnerabilities (Try to <em>rm</em> a file called <em>-rf</em> for instance).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/GoingBright.pdf">&gt; <strong>Going Bright: Wiretapping without Weakening Communications Infrastructure</strong> (2013)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Taking advantage of [existing vulnerabilities] is far preferable to introducing new vulnerabilities into other applications or infrastructure […]”. Better, yes, but not <em>good</em>. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-nsa-flaws-insight-idUSKCN0SV2XQ20151107">Also somewhat related.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-kemerlis.pdf">&gt; <strong>ret2dir: Rethinking Kernel Isolation</strong> (2014)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting, practical paper doing useful research. The authors, which were also nominated for a <a href="http://pwnies.com/nominations/">Pwnie</a>, also released all source code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/phdis2008/yqcheng.2008/ROPecker-NDSS14.pdf">&gt; <strong>ROPecker: A Generic and Practical Approach for Defending Against ROP Attacks</strong> (2014)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool research on ROP attack mitigations. Does not modify the binary - neither on disk or at runtime - and is thus much more suited to general application. Unfortunately only protects user-space code and there are a few ways to bypass the techniques. Fortunately, these techniques greatly increase the cost of an adversary, reducing the likelyhood you will fall victim to an attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#TODO#">&gt; <strong>Protecting Android Apps Against Reverse Engineering by the Use of the Native Code</strong> (2015)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authors propose techniques to raise efforts needed to reverse engineer Android applications by introducing <em>one</em> native function responsible for field accesses, method call indirection and opaque predicates. Not a huge fan, considering the performance (and therefore <em>battery</em>) impact is on the order of 10x to 30x.</p>
